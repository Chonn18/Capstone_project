# [Capstone project 2025] MRFormer: Multi stage Restoration CT Image

My capstone project focuses on image restoration and super-resolution for CT images. it's based on paper [MWFormer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10767188)

## Architecture

![Fig](./Backend/img/kientruc.png)
The architecture of MRFormer. The main image processing network consists of a Transformer encoder, a Transformer decoder, and convolution tails. (a) A feature extraction network learns to generate some of the parameters of the Transformer blocks and intra-patch Transformer blocks in the main network, thereby partially controlling the production of intermediate feature maps. (b) The Transformer block in the encoder of the main network, which is guided by the feature vector. (c) Transformer decoder of the main network, whose queries are learnable parameters.

## Different Variants

![Fig](./Backend/img/variant.drawio.png)
In addition to the default architecture, I also developed test-time variants applied in special cases. Conduct a single Noise-type restoration with the feature extraction network. To conduct hybrid Noise restoration that Ire unseen during training, the image processing network is cascaded to remove degradations sequentially, stage by stage.

## Results

### Results on LDCT images

### Results on hybrid-Noise degradations unseen during training
